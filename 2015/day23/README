wow, don't look at this.

Was going to build a VM and ASM, but later decided to make it one prog.

asm.c    is the beginning of the assmbler
turing.c is the in memory assembler/vm, uses a struct instead of packing an instruction

asm also has a bug in the comments at the top, JMO is JUMP IF ONE, not JUMP IF ODD
